MVP
--------
Show each pokemon, one page
    -- sort options?
    -- region tabs? default to all regions?
show pokemon details (should this be routed or expanded on one page)
    - routed could have a pokeball opening animation when the page loads
        -- toggleable?
    -try to include as much details as possible
        -- needs to be finalized before details page is designed

error page for rate limit

Ideas
--------
Random option
    - gets random pokemon

hover over card does some type of animation

Dark mode


instead of pagination, just break it into generational groups
    - default to all? At least keep query for getting all but include generation
